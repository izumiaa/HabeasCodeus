The appellant was born in Libya in February 1988, but he has lived much of his life in this country and he is a British citizen. In February 2009, as a result of executing a search warrant at his house, police officers found videos on his computer uploaded onto various websites, including the YouTube website. These videos included ones that showed (i) attacks by members of Al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other proscribed groups on military targets in Chechnya, and on the Coalition forces in Iraq and in Afghanistan, (ii) the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) against Coalition forces, (iii) excerpts from martyrdom videos, and (iv) clips of attacks on civilians in the United States of America, such as the 9/11 attack on New The 2000 ActSection 1 of the 2000 Act is headed Terrorism: Interpretation, and, as amended by the 2006 Act and the Counter Terrorism Act 2008, it provides as follows: (1) In this Act terrorism means the use or threat of action where (a) the action falls within subsection (2), (b) is designed to influence the international governmental government or an organisation or to intimidate the public or a section of the public, and (c) is made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial or ideological cause. (2) Action falls within this subsection if it is designed seriously to interfere with or seriously to disrupt an electronic system. (3) The use of the use of a weapon or the threat of using a weapon is a reference to any person, or to property, wherever situated, and the government means the government of a country other than the United Kingdom, or of a part of the Although the appellant was convicted of offences contrary to section 2 of the 2006 Act, the issue which has to be addressed involves the interpretation of section 1 of the 2000 Act, and, in particular, the meaning of the word terrorism. Terrorism is, of course, central to the offences in issue. In finding him guilty on the five counts, the jury must have been satisfied that the videos which the appellant uploaded satisfied the requirements of section 2(3)(a) of the2006 Act. If some or all of the activities shown in the uploaded videos, whose contents are briefly described in paras 2(i) to (iv) above, did not involve terrorism within the meaning and the scope of the provisions of the Terrorism Act 2000 and of Part 1 of this Act, it is possible that the appellant may have been acquitted, or had been acquitted on some or There are great difficulties in finding a satisfactory definition of terrorism, suspected that none will succeed us will succeed in finding the effective definition of the Act. The Crown argues that, particularly given the purpose of the 2000 Act, terrorism cannot be narrowly defined, if one is to allow for the many disparate forms which terrorism may take, and the inevitable changes which will occur in international relations, in political regimes in other countries, and in the UKs foreign policy. Thus, on occasions, activities which might command a measure of public understanding, if not support, may fall within it: for example, activities by the victims of oppression abroad, in the same way as those carried out by the perpetrators of terrorism in this country, in order to advance a very wide range of causes. It is clear that it is very hard to define terrorism. Accordingly, runs the argument, a see Secretary, while the words used in section 1 of the 2000 Act, and the language used by the Secretary of State in relation to the definition of terrorism, are good reasons for the wide interpretation of the definition. He pointed out that the consequence of the very broad definition was to grant unusually wide discretions to all those concerned with the application of the counter terrorism law, from Ministers exercising their power to impose executive orders to police officers deciding whom to arrest or to stop at a border, to customs officers deciding whether or not to stop a vessel at a port, to judges deciding whether to arrest a person on the basis of a warrant, to prosecutors deciding which cases to prosecute. He also made the point that if special legal rules are to be devised in relation or to terrorism, they should be limited in their application, and justified on a basis of operational necessity. He said that he was not If the attacks on Coalition forces in Afghanistan and Iraq, and on militarytargets in Chechnya, shown on the seized videos would otherwise amount to terrorism as defined in section 1 of the 2000 Act, the appellant contends that this would be contrary to, or inconsistent with, the norms of international law. The appellant seeks to meet this point through the contention that, whereas there is no international agreement as to the meaning of terrorism, there is a general understanding that it does not extend to the acts of insurgents or freedom fighters in non international armed conflicts. As the Court of Appeal said in para 35, while international law has developed so that It 1963 Convention on Offences and Certain Other Acts Committed on Board Aircraft; 1970 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft; 2010 Protocol Supplementary to the Convention for a Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes Against Internationally Protected Persons; 1971 Convention on International Law and the Prevention of the Taking of Hostages; 1979 International Convention against the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material; 1988 Protocol for the Developing Countries for the Prohibition of Violence at Airports Serving International Civil Aviation; 1991 Convention on Preventing and Combating the Use of Weapons of Mass Destruction and Improperly Improvised Explosive Devices for the Purpose of Detection; 1995 International Convention on Improper Use of Explosives for the Use in Armed Conflict; 1996 International Convention to Prevent the Proliferation of Explosive Substances; 1999 International Convention for Combating Terrorism and the Financing of Terrorism; 2001 International Convention of the Suppressing of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism; 2010 Convention on Terrorism and Terrorism-related Acts Relating to International Airports; 2005 Convention on Terrorist Attacks on the Safety of International Air Navigation; 2004 Convention on Combatants and Insurg We would accordingly answer the certified question yes, and consequently we would dismiss this appeal. Before ending this judgment, we would make two further points of a general nature about the 2000 and 2006 Acts. First, we revert to the concern about the width of the definition of terrorism, as discussed in paras 28 29 and 33 37 above. In his first report, Mr Anderson QC made the point that the current law allows members of any nationalist or separatist group to be turned into terrorists by virtue of their participation in a lawful armed conflict, however great the provocation and however odious the regime which they have attacked. He went on to say that other definitions of terrorism choose to exclude activities sanctioned by international law from the reach of terrorist activity, citing the Canadian
