The appellant, Secret Hotels2 Ltd (formerly called Med Hotels Ltd, and known as Med), marketed holiday accommodation, consisting of around 2,500 resort hotels, villas, and apartments in the Mediterranean and the Caribbean, through a website, www.medhotels.com (the website). In these proceedings, everyone has focussed on hotel rooms, and has ignored villas and apartments, and I shall do the same. An hotelier who wished his hotel to be marketed by Med had to enter into a written agreement with Med headed global hotels Terms and Conditions for allotment contracts, which I will call the Accommodation Agreement. When a potential customer (be it travel agent or holiday maker) logged onto The Commissioners analysis based on TOMS resulted in their assessing Med to liability for VAT in respect of the relevant period on the basis that TOMS applied. The Commissioners justified this on the ground that Med was a travel agent within the meaning of article 306, which deal[t] with customers [namely travel agents and, less frequently, holiday makers directly] in [its] own name and use[d] the services of other taxable persons [nameli the hoteliers] in the provision of travel facilities. In effect, the Commissioners analysis was that Med booked a room in a hotel for the net sum, which it paid to the hotelier when the holiday had ended, and Med supplied the room to its customer in the sum of 5,643, The outcome of this appeal ultimately turns on the question whether Meds activities in relation to the provision of hotel rooms to customers fell within article 306.1(b). That question must be decided by the proper application of the provisions of article 306 to the circumstances of this case. So far as the law is concerned, what article 306 means and how it is to be applied is a matter of EU law, a topic on which the decisions of the Court of Justice of the European Community, the CJEU, are binding on national courts see eg Customs and Excise Commissioners v Madgett and Baldwin (Joined cases C 308/96 and C 94/97) [1998] STC 1189. In that connection, it is worth referring to the observation of The CJEU has given guidance as to the proper approach to be adopted in a case such as the present. Where the question at issue involves more than one contractual arrangement between different parties, this Court has emphasised that, when assessing the issue of who supplies what services to whom for VAT purposes, regard must be had to all the circumstances in which the transaction or combination of transactions takes place per Lord Reed in Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Aimia Coalition Loyalty UK Ltd [2013] 2 All ER 719, para 38. As he went on to explain, this requires the whole of the relationships between the various parties being considered. Given that the contractual position normally reflects the economic and commercial reality of the transactions and in The provisions of the contractual documentation were set out extensively in the Tribunal decisions below see paras 27 36 of the FTTs decision, and paras 10 40 of Morgan Js decision. The effect of the documentation is to determine whether or not the relationship between Med, the hotelier, and the customer is in fact an agency arrangement. This is a slightly more sophisticated analysis than the single issue as it has been agreed between the parties, as set out in para 16 above, but, as will become apparent, at least in the circumstances of this case, it amounts to the same thing. Turning first to the Accommodation Agreement, it begins by identifying the hoteliers as the Principal and Med as the Agent, and goes on to provide that, for a specified season, certain types (and sometimes certain Having decided that the effect of the contractual documentation between hoteliers, Med, and customers is that Med marketed and sold hotel accommodation to customers as the agent of the hoteliers and the hotelier, I turn to consider the characteristics of the way in which Med conducted its business which persuaded the FTT and the Court of Appeal that Med was acting as the hotel accommodation agent rather than as a principal. At the end of his judgment, Sir John Chadwick summarised the main factors as follows (with the addition of subparagraphs and adaptations to reflect the terminology adopted in this judgment): (1) Med dealt with customers in its own name (a) in respect of the use of its website and (b) in the services of its local The decision of the FTT cannot stand, as they appear to have held that, after taking into account the way in which Med conducted its business, the true effect of the written contractual arrangements between Med and the hoteliers was not that Med was an agent through whom the hotelier provided the customer with a room, but rather that Med acted as an agent, as opposed to the person providing the customers with hotel rooms. For the reasons I given, that analysis is unsustainable. The Commissioners contend that the factors identified in para 45 above justify the conclusion that the agency arrangement was somehow varied by the parties conduct, and in particular the conduct of Med, as the commercially dominant party, so that it became the customer and the customer became the agent of the hotel, as I in the light of the discussion in paras 45 50 above, it seems to me that economic reality does not assist a contrary view. As is realistically, if impliedly, acknowledged by the Commissioners (and indeed by Med) in the reformulated agreed issue on this appeal (as set out in para 16 above), once it has been decided that Med was, as it contends, the hoteliers agent in relation to the supply of accommodation to customers as a matter of English law, it follows, at least on the facts of this case, that it was an intermediary for the purpose
